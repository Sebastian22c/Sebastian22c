Access to justice is a prerequisite for the full enjoyment of fundamental human rights. However,
the goal of ensuring that the Ghanaian justice system is structured and administered in a manner
that provides its citizens and residents with the knowledge, resources, and services they require
to address their legal problems has unfortunately remained subtle. The problem stems from the
alienation and exclusion of many individuals from the system, due to challenges that include
difficulties in accessing legal information; physical and material barriers to accessing institutions
of justice; the prohibitive cost of legal proceedings; weak and inadequate legal aid to enable less
affluent members of society to access justice, and poor co-ordination between the various
Institutions Of Justice.
At a workshop organized by the Legal Resource Center in Prampram to educate participants on the roles and mandates of state institution in accessing justice. Facilitating the workshop, rule of law specialist at LRC Mr. Enock Jengre stated access to justice has become necessary. Many of the citizenry lack knowledge and therefore it behooves on state institutions to educate the general public in accessing justice when the arise. 
Speaking at the workshop, the Ningo-Prampram District Director for The National Commission for Civic Education, Mr. Oppong Mensah highlighted the commission’s mandate in access justice by the citizenry. 
According to Mr. Mensah, “The mandate is made up of establishment and functions of NCCE. Our mandate is the Constitutional authority the Commission has to undertake its functions.”
Article 231 of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana establishes the Commission and the National Commission for Civic Education act; Act 452 creates the Commission. He added.
He further stated both Article 233 of the Constitution and Section 2 of Act 452 of 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) mandate the NCCE to perform the following functions:
(a) To create and sustain within the society the awareness of the principles and objectives of the Constitution as the fundamental law of the people of Ghana;
(b) To educate and encourage the public to defend the Constitution at all times, against all forms of abuse and violation;
(c) To formulate for the consideration of Government from time to time, programmes at the National, Regional and District levels aimed at realizing the objectives of the Constitution;
(d) To formulate, implement and oversee programmes intended to inculcate in the citizens of Ghana awareness of their civic responsibilities and an appreciation of their rights and obligations as free people; and
(e) Such other functions as Parliament may prescribe.
In the performance of our functions, the following are among the mediums through which we reach out to our target groups; Face to face delivery with identifiable and non-identifiable groups, Community durbar, Town hall meetings, Mobile van announcements, public education through community information centers, the media etc.  
“As a Commission, the role we play in ensuring access to justice in Ghana as enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana is inculcating the tenants of the Laws of Ghana in the general public. Among other things, when individuals come to us with issues, after listening to them, we refer them to the appropriate institutions that are legally mandated to address such issues.” He stated. 
Another state institution empowered to educate the citizenry in regards to access to justice is the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ).
the Ningo-Prampram District director for CHRAJ, Madam Velvert Ashitey underscored the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) was established by Act 456 on the 6th July 1993 pursuant to Article216 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana.
